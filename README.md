# MockRiskGenerator
This is a very simplistic simulation of events that one might expect from a trading risk system.  There are
three parts to the simulator:

1) Activity simulation - this part simulates the different activities that would trigger risks to be calculated.
the activities are:  market data changes, trading activity and business event activity (e.g., end of day)

2) Business process simulation - this simulates the processes that are undertaken as a consequence of the 
above activities.  This includes calculating the valuations and risks for trading activity and husiness events.

3) Persistence and publication - this part simulates the data storaging, indexing and publishing of the 
consequences of the activity and business processes.


#Using the simulator
To start the simulator run the following

gradle bootRun

There is one predefined configuration which includes a single pricing group called "FXDesk".  To see the configuration
go to the following URL


http://localhost:30001/getPricingGroupConfig?name=FXDesk


then to start all the processes go to the following URL

localhost:30001/startprocess/FXDesk

There are several other uris that provide a way to looking up trade populations etc.


<h2> Structure of the code </h2>
There are seven packages

<h3>com.reporting.mocks.configuration</h3>
This contains closs models to hold the application configuration and is broken down into
three main pairts

<h4>TradeConfig</h4>
Defines the trade types, underlyings and the rate at which new, modify and delete trade events occur.

<h4>IntradayConfig</h4>
Defines the preiodicity at which intraday market events occur.  These market events trigger subsequent risk calculations.

<h4>EndofDayConfig<h4>
Defines the periodicity at which end of day market events occur.

<h3>com.reporting.mocks.Controllers</h3>
This package contains all the REST endpoints of the application.  Different urls are provided to start
the application processing, provide access to trade populations and market data.

<h3>com.reporting.mocks.endpoints</h3>
This package contains a set of example publishers of the events generated by the application.  Three are
provided for publishing to Java Queues, Apache Kafka and to Apache Ignite.

<h3>com.reporting.mocks.generators</h3>
This package contains the a set of classes to generate different events and risk results.

<h3>com.reporting.mocks.model</h3>
This is a set of classes that model the set of business objects such as risks, trades and markets.

<h3>com.reporting.mocks.peristence</h3>
This is a simple mock persitence layer.

<h3>com.reporting.mocks.process</h3>
The main set of classes that create the threads for generating all the events, be that market or trade events.
